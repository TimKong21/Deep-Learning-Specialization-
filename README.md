# Deep Learning Specialization

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. 

This Specialization helps build and train neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learn how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. Get ready to master theoretical concepts and their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow and tackle real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more.
